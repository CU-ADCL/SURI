This research aims to expand the algorithmic capability for tasking sensors to investigate human-specified hypotheses about space objects (SOs).
The goal is to improve the ability to evaluate internal- and physical- state hypotheses in cases where there are many objects and a collection of sensors with diverse capabilities.


**Problem Description**
Describe the problem of catalog maintenance and hypothesis resolution


**Technical Approach**
Describe our technical approach:
1. Generating a base plan using ILP
2. Plan only over the OOI, where an action is a change in the plan
