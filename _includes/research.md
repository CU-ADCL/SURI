This research aims to expand the algorithmic capability for tasking sensors to investigate human-specified hypotheses about space objects (SOs).
The goal is to improve the ability to evaluate internal- and physical- state hypotheses in cases where there are many objects and a collection of sensors with diverse capabilities.
